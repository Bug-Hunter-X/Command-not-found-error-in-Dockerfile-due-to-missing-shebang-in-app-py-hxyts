This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles when using Python. The issue arises from not specifying the correct shebang in the main Python script.  The Dockerfile uses `CMD ["python3", "./app.py"]`, assuming the script is executable directly.  However, without the `#!/usr/bin/env python3` shebang at the beginning of app.py, the system cannot locate the interpreter.  The solution shows how to correctly set the shebang to fix the issue.
